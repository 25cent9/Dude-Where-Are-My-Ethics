It is the annual Christmas party and you participate in the White Elephant gift exchange. Somebody takes the gift that you really want from you after you've run out of steals.
Joke that you really wanted it and continue with the game.
Jokingly try to swap the gift after the game has ended.
Accpet that you've lost that gift and move on.
Follow them home and steal it in the dead of night.
