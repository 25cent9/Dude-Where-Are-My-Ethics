There is a team outing that is coming up in the next few days but it is organized by someone that you hate so you're bitter.
Show up and thank the organizer for their hardwork.
Show up and try to enjoy yourself.
Show up but keep a very netural attitude.
Tell the organizer that they're garbage at what they do and the event is absolute rubbish.
