There is a team outing that is coming up in the next few days and you're asked if you will be attending.
The person who organized the outing is someone that you dislike.
Show up and thank the organizer for their hardwork.
Show up and try to enjoy yourself.
Show up but keep a very netural attitude.
Tell the organizer that they're garbage at what they do and the event is absolute rubbish.
