You love Christmas but hate the mention of it in before Thanksgiving. Becky, who sits next to you, is playing Christmas music at max volume.
Tell her that the season isn't around just yet and she should be considerate of other's opinions on Christmas before Thanksgiving.
Tell her that it how much it specifically bothers you.
Put on your headphones and ignore the music she is playing.
Rip her speaker out of her desk SubZero style.
