Becky, who sits next to you, is playing Christmas music at max volume.
You love Christmas but not in November.
Tell her that she should be considerate of other's opinions on Christmas before Thanksgiving.
Tell her that it how much it specifically bothers you.
Put on your headphones and ignore the music she is playing.
Rip her speaker out of her desk SubZero style.
