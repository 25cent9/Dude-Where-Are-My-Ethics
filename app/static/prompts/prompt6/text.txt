You attend the corporate picnic and accidently hit the CEO's car in an empty parking lot.
Their car was parked and you were too busy checking your phone.
Find them and exchange insurance information in person.
Leave a note with your insureance information but never see them in person. 
Run!
Shift the blame onto a Co-Worker that you hate.
